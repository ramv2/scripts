# Python script sample
A sample script I wrote in Python to read in different command line options, process them and perform one of three different operations on them:
  1. Create jobs that can then be submitted in a cluster.
  2. Check to see the status of the jobs that are either currently running or finished.
  3. Process the simulation output files to extract meaningful information
